Now that we have access to our list, we've got a ton of different options.</div><br><br>

### Viewing the 'Totals' Bar:
* Today's Date : Just a nice little reminder of what today is so you don't have to look elsewhere.
* This Month's Expenses : this is adds up all the expenses due this month, if there is a specific bill that you've added this month that isn't recurring it will show up in this amount as well. This is great to see if you have a one time payment or an expense due that doesn't normally happen.
* Total Monthly Expenses : This is as it claims, all your recurring monthly expenses will add up here.
* Current Balance : This is what is still due this month.

### Bill Options:

  And for when you've paid a lot, the pop up will display 10 items at a time.<br><br></div>
  
### Account Overview
In the event that a bill has been created, has been paid and isn't recurring, it will disappear from your main list but you can view all of your previous bills in your account overview or let's say that you're no longer paying a monthly bill anymore, if you click the edit button and turn off the monthly bill checkbox, it will also remove it from your main list but keep it in your account overview. This is a nifty feature to just keep all your past bills in one spot, which you can of course delete if you don't want to keep them.
