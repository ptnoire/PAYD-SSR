Now that we have access to our list, we've got a ton of different options.</div><br><br>

### Viewing the 'Totals' Bar:
* Today's Date : Just a nice little reminder of what today is so you don't have to look elsewhere.
* This Month's Expenses : this is adds up all the expenses due this month, if there is a specific bill that you've added this month that isn't recurring it will show up in this amount as well. This is great to see if you have a one time payment or an expense due that doesn't normally happen.
* Total Monthly Expenses : This is as it claims, all your recurring monthly expenses will add up here.
* Current Balance : This is what is still due this month.

### Bill Options:
